### Experiment Idea
- Check the impact of seq. Length used in the IMU Encoder for the Unseen class prediction


#### Setup
- *All unseen semantic vectors are subset of seen semantic vectors -> to remove the unseen vector approximation complexity
- Change the window length / window overlap 
- Change IMU Encoder [BiLSTM , Trans ]
- Change IMU dataset form [Pure, Aggregated]
